# Metamorph

Exploring and experimenting what could be an interface for end-user programming

This project is *really* early in development.

![Current State Screenshot](./current.png)

This projects uses :

- Electron
- Vite
- Vue
- TailwindCSS
- XState (soon)

## Usage

- `yarn` (once, to install dependencies)
- `yarn start` (to run playground)

## Inspirations

> There shouldn’t be a chasm that the user has to cross in order to customize the behavior of their software. Going from using to inspecting to modifying the system should be a gradual process where each of the steps is small enough to be easily discoverable. The user should not need to switch to “programmer mindset” but instead stay within the context of the application. They can stay close to their work and their ideas.
